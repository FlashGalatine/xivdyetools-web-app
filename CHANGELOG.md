---

## [4.1.1] - 2026-01-21

### 📱 Mobile UX Improvements

#### Fixed

**Tap Outside to Close Drawer**
- Added semi-transparent overlay behind the Color Palette drawer on mobile
- Tapping outside the drawer (on the darkened area) now closes it
- Follows the same pattern as the existing sidebar overlay for consistency
- Improves mobile UX by matching expected "tap outside to dismiss" behavior

**Tool Banner First Tool Hidden**
- Fixed the Harmony tool being cut off on the left side of the tool banner on mobile
- Changed tool banner alignment from `center` to `flex-start` on mobile viewports
- First tool (Harmony) is now always visible; users can scroll right to see remaining tools

**Drawer Reappears After Tool Switch**
- Fixed bug where the Color Palette drawer would reappear when switching between tools
- Drawer now correctly stays closed when switching from a tool with palette (e.g., Harmony) to a tool without (e.g., Swatch) and back to another tool with palette (e.g., Mixer)
- Changed drawer's default `isOpen` state from `true` to `false` to fix Lit property binding edge case

**Vision Tool Contrast Table Horizontal Scroll**
- Fixed Contrast Ratios and Pairwise Contrast Comparison tables being cut off on mobile
- Tables now scroll horizontally within their container instead of shifting the entire page
- Added `overflow-x: auto` to table containers for proper mobile scrolling behavior

**Compare Tool Charts Responsive Layout**
- Fixed Hue-Saturation Plot and Brightness Distribution charts being cramped side-by-side on mobile
- Charts now stack vertically (single column) on mobile viewports (<768px)
- Charts display side-by-side (two columns) on desktop viewports (≥768px)
- Uses JavaScript-based viewport detection since Tailwind responsive classes don't work in dynamically created DOM

**Swatch Tool Mobile Layout**
- Fixed color grid bleeding off left/right edges on mobile (was 420px fixed on 390px viewport)
- Grid now dynamically resizes swatch buttons to fit viewport while maintaining 8-column layout (mimics in-game arrangement)
- Results section now stacks below the grid on mobile instead of requiring horizontal scroll
- Added auto-scroll to results when selecting a color on mobile, so users immediately see matching dyes
- Fixed bug where users couldn't scroll back up to the grid after selecting a color on mobile
  - Root cause: `mainLayout` container was constrained by flexbox to 620px while grid was 935px, causing grid to overflow above the scroll container's viewport
  - Fix: Changed `mainLayout` from implicit `flex: 0 1 auto` to explicit `flex: 0 0 auto` to prevent height shrinking
- Desktop layout unchanged: horizontal layout with grid on left, results on right

**Gradient Tool Mobile Layout**
- Fixed gradient builder UI being cramped on mobile (80px circles + 24px step markers on 390px viewport)
- Node circles now scale down from 80px (desktop) to 60px (mobile)
- Step markers scale down from 24px to 16px on mobile for better fit
- Reduced path margins (16px → 8px) and builder padding (20px → 12px) on mobile
- Added `updateGradientLayout()` method for responsive behavior
- Added window resize listener to update layout dynamically

**Extractor Tool Mobile Layout**
- Fixed image drop zone taking up too much vertical space on mobile (300px on 390px viewport)
- Image section now scales down from 300px (desktop) to 180px (mobile) when an image is loaded
- Empty drop zone (no image) uses 220px height on mobile to still show upload UI clearly
- Reduced layout padding (32px → 16px) and gap (32px → 16px) on mobile
- Users can now see at least one full result card without scrolling after extracting a palette
- Added `updateExtractorLayout()` method for responsive behavior
- Added window resize listener to update layout dynamically

## [4.1.0] - 2026-01-18

### ⚙️ Configurable Color Matching Algorithms

**Status**: ✅ RELEASE
**Focus**: User-configurable color matching algorithms for 5 tools, with algorithm-aware result display.

#### New Features ✅

**Matching Algorithm Configuration**
- Added "Matching Algorithm" dropdown to config sidebar for 5 tools:
  - Harmony Explorer
  - Palette Extractor
  - Gradient Builder
  - Dye Mixer
  - Swatch Matcher
- 5 algorithm choices with descriptive labels:
  - **OKLAB** - Recommended (modern perceptual, best balance)
  - **HyAB** - Best for Palettes (hybrid, large color differences)
  - **CIEDE2000** - Industry Standard (accurate with correction factors)
  - **CIE76** - Fast (simple LAB Euclidean)
  - **RGB** - Basic (fastest but least perceptual)
- Full i18n support for all 6 languages (EN, JA, DE, FR, KO, ZH)

**Algorithm-Aware Result Display**
- Result cards now display which algorithm calculated the distance
- Algorithm name shows instead of generic "ΔE" label (e.g., "OKLAB", "HyAB")
- Color coding adapts to algorithm scale:
  - RGB uses 0-442 scale (Euclidean in 255³ space)
  - Perceptual algorithms use 0-10+ scale (industry standard)
- Informative tooltip explains the algorithm used

**Harmony Tool UI Fix**
- Fixed duplicate "Matching Algorithm" labels
- Renamed section to "Matching Mode" to distinguish perceptual vs hue-based toggle
- Matching Algorithm dropdown only appears when Perceptual Matching is enabled
- Hue-based matching doesn't need algorithm selection (uses hue angles)

#### Technical Details

**New Types** (from `@xivdyetools/core`)
- `MatchingMethod` type added to tool configs
- `ResultCardData.matchingMethod` for passing algorithm info to cards

**Files Modified**
- `config-sidebar.ts` - Added matching method dropdown for 5 tools
- `tool-config-types.ts` - Added `matchingMethod` to tool configs
- `result-card.ts` - Algorithm-aware distance display
- `harmony-tool.ts`, `gradient-tool.ts`, `extractor-tool.ts`, `mixer-tool.ts`, `swatch-tool.ts` - Wire up matching method
- All 6 locale files - New translation keys for matching methods

#### Fixed (Deep-Dive Audit 2026-01-19)

- **WEB-BUG-001**: Fixed event listener accumulation risk in DyeSelector. Changed `manageBtn.addEventListener()` to `this.on()` for proper cleanup via `unbindAllEvents()`
- **WEB-BUG-003**: Fixed race condition in palette import count. Consolidated two separate storage reads into one to prevent TOCTOU race
- **WEB-OPT-003**: Verified MarketBoardService lazy-loading already optimized (singleton cache, on-demand fetching, request versioning)
- **WEB-REF-003 Phase 1**: Extracted pure algorithmic logic from large components. Created `mixer-blending-engine.ts` (~180 lines) and `harmony-generator.ts` (~280 lines) services, reducing MixerTool by ~120 lines and HarmonyTool by ~200 lines
- **WEB-REF-003 Phase 2**: Eliminated desktop ↔ drawer code duplication using shared panel builder pattern. Created shared builder methods (`buildDyeSelectorPanel`, `buildSettingsSlider`, `buildHarmonyTypeSelector`, etc.) that return component references for reuse. MixerTool reduced ~180 lines, HarmonyTool reduced ~250 lines
- **WEB-REF-003 Phase 3**: Extracted panel controllers to shared service. Created `tool-panel-builders.ts` with `buildFiltersPanel()` and `buildMarketPanel()` functions. Refactored gradient-tool (~40 lines reduced) and extractor-tool (~50 lines reduced) to use shared builders. Other tools can incrementally adopt the pattern.
- **WEB-REF-003 Phase 4**: Completed shared services layer. Created `price-utilities.ts` (~170 lines) with formatPriceWithSuffix, getDyePriceDisplay, preparePriceCardData, and batch operation helpers. Created `display-options-helper.ts` (~120 lines) with applyDisplayOptions and mergeWithDefaults utilities. Migrated ExtractorTool to use centralized MarketBoardService with getter pattern for showPrices/priceData, providing race condition protection and shared price cache across all tools.
- **Market Board Server Changes**: Fixed Extractor Tool not fetching new prices when Market Board server is changed via ConfigSidebar. Added event relay in MarketBoard component to bridge MarketBoardService events (EventTarget) to DOM CustomEvents that tools can listen to.
- **Price Category Filters**: Added 5 price category toggles to ConfigSidebar Market Board section (Base Dyes, Craft Dyes, Allied Society Dyes, Cosmic Dyes, Special Dyes). Controls which dye types have their market prices fetched.
- **Default Server/Categories**: Updated market defaults - Server: Crystal (was Balmung); Base Dyes: Off; Craft Dyes: Off; Allied Society Dyes: On; Cosmic Dyes: On; Special Dyes: On.

#### Share Button Improvements (2026-01-20)

**Accessibility Tool**
- Added vision type dropdown selector next to Share button, allowing users to choose which color vision deficiency type to include in shared URLs (instead of defaulting to first enabled)
- Moved Share button from left panel to "Selected Dyes" header in right panel for better visibility

**Comparison Tool**
- Moved Share button from left panel (inside DyeSelector) to "Selected Dyes" header in right panel for consistency with other tools
- Fixed Share button remaining disabled when dyes were loaded from localStorage on page load
- Fixed Share button not updating when dyes added via Color Palette (only updated when added via DyeSelector)
- Fixed Share button not updating when dyes cleared via "Clear All" button

**Localization**
- Added `shareAs` translation key ("Share as:") for vision type dropdown label
- Added `addDye` translation key ("Add Dye") for DyeSelector button

#### Dependencies

- Updated `@xivdyetools/core` to ^1.13.0 for matching algorithm support

---

## [3.2.5] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **Dye Mixer Context Menu**: Added action dropdown menu to "Intermediate Dye Matches" results, allowing users to quickly add matched dyes to Comparison, Mixer, Accessibility Checker, see Color Harmonies, Budget Suggestions, or copy hex codes

---

## [3.2.4] - 2025-12-23

### Fixed

- **See Color Harmonies**: Fixed the "See Color Harmonies" context menu action in Color Matcher not displaying results in the Harmony Explorer. The issue was caused by `setActiveToolId()` in `TwoPanelShell` triggering a duplicate navigation call that stripped the `dyeId` URL parameter. The fix ensures programmatic tool changes via `setActiveToolId()` update the UI without re-triggering navigation.

---

## [3.2.3] - 2025-12-22

### Added

- **Harmony Explorer Context Menu**: Added "Add to Accessibility Checker" option to quickly add a dye to the Accessibility tool for color vision analysis

---

## [3.2.2] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- **Harmony Explorer Context Menu**: Added "See Budget Suggestions" option to quickly load a dye into the Budget tool
- **Slot Selection Modal**: When Comparison (4 slots) or Mixer (2 slots) is full, a modal now lets you choose which slot to replace
- **Duplicate Detection**: Toast notification appears if you try to add a dye that's already in Comparison or Mixer

### Fixed

- **Context Menu Actions**: "Add to Comparison" and "Add to Mixer" now work correctly - they save the dye to localStorage and navigate to the respective tool
- **SVG Icons**: Replaced emoji icons (⚖️, 🌈, 📋) with filled SVG icons for better visibility and consistency

### Changed

- **Navigation**: Context menu actions now automatically navigate to the target tool after adding a dye

---

## [3.2.1] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed

- **Harmony Explorer**: Fixed Facewear colors appearing in harmony results. The `findClosestDyesToHue()` method now properly excludes Facewear dyes (generic names like "Red", "Blue") from harmony calculations, matching the behavior of the core library's `HarmonyGenerator`.

---

## [3.2.0] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Universalis Proxy**: Market Board API requests now route through a CORS proxy to prevent browser errors when Universalis returns rate limit (429) responses without CORS headers
- **Environment Configuration**: Added `VITE_UNIVERSALIS_PROXY_URL` environment variable support for local development proxy configuration

### Fixed

- **CORS Issues**: Resolved browser CORS errors that occurred when Universalis API returned error responses (429, 500) without proper CORS headers

---

## [3.1.1] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed

- **Performance**: Fixed Market Board price fetching making sequential API requests instead of batched requests. The Core's `getPricesForDataCenter()` now fetches all prices in a single API call instead of N individual requests, reducing fetch time from O(N x 200ms) to ~200ms for typical use cases.
- **Dye Mixer**: Fixed prices not displaying in Intermediate Dye Matches section when "Show Prices" is enabled. The batch API fix ensures prices load quickly and are displayed correctly.

---

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

**Focus**: Improved clarity of contrast information in the Accessibility Checker tool.

#### Breaking Changes ⚠️

**Removed Confusing Scores**
- Removed "Contrast Score" (0-100) which was calculated as `min(contrastLight, contrastDark) * 20` - a confusing metric
- Removed "Overall Accessibility Score" summary which combined multiple factors into an unclear single number

#### New Features ✅

**Clear WCAG Contrast Display**
- Shows actual WCAG contrast ratios (e.g., "4.5:1", "7.2:1") instead of arbitrary 0-100 scores
- Displays contrast vs White and contrast vs Black separately for each dye
- Shows WCAG compliance level badges (AAA ≥7:1, AA ≥4.5:1, Fail <4.5:1)

**Improved Pair Comparisons**
- Shows actual contrast ratio between dye pairs (1-21 WCAG scale)
- Displays distinguishability scores per vision type (normal, deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia)
- Warns when pairs are hard to distinguish for specific colorblindness types

**Reduced Maximum Dyes**
- Changed from 12 dyes to 4 dyes maximum for clearer, more focused analysis

#### Theme Improvements ✅

**Theme-Aware Warning Colors**
- Added semantic text color utility classes (`.text-warning`, `.text-error`, `.text-success`, `.text-info`)
- Warning text now uses CSS variable `--toast-warning-text` for theme adaptation
- Applied amber warning color (`#b45309`) to all light themes for better contrast:
  - Standard Light
  - Cotton Candy
  - Grayscale Light
  - High Contrast Light
  - Parchment Light
  - Hydaelyn Light

#### Files Modified ✅
- `src/components/accessibility-checker-tool.ts` - Complete redesign of contrast display

### 🔧 Test Fixes

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Focus**: Fixed two failing unit tests in app-layout and dye-selector components.

#### Bug Fixes ✅

**Fixed: AppLayout Picture Element Test** (Issue: Expected 3 source elements, got 1)
- **Root Cause**: Logo picture element had only 1 WebP source with density descriptors
- **Test Expectation**: 3 source elements for responsive images (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Fix**: Replaced single WebP source with 3 separate sources using media queries
  - Mobile source: `(max-width: 640px)` → `icon-40x40.webp`
  - Tablet source: `(max-width: 1024px)` → `icon-60x60.webp`
  - Desktop source: (default) → `icon-80x80.webp`
- **Result**: Better responsive image handling and test compliance

**Fixed: DyeSelector Category Button Highlighting** (Issue: Expected `text-white` class, got inline style)
- **Root Cause**: Active category buttons used inline `style="color: var(--theme-text-header)"` instead of Tailwind classes
- **Test Expectation**: `text-white` class on active category buttons
- **Fix**: Updated 3 locations in dye-selector.ts to use `text-white` class
  - Initial render: Neutral category default highlighting (line 192)
  - Click handler: Category button activation (line 400)
  - Update method: Category state re-application (line 621)
- **Result**: More consistent Tailwind CSS usage and passing tests

#### Test Results ✅

  - Analogous: 3 dyes (base + 2)
  - Triadic: 3 dyes (base + 2)
  - Split-Complementary, Tetradic, Square, Monochromatic, Compound, Shades configured with specific limits
- **Expanded Suggestions**: Simple mode + additional similar dyes per harmony dye
  - Adds 1 companion dye for each harmony dye using color distance (like Dye Mixer)
  - Facewear dyes excluded from additional companions
  - Example: Tetradic shows 4 base + 3 additional = 7 total
- UI: Radio buttons in Harmony Explorer options section
- Preference persisted in localStorage key: `xivdyetools_harmony_suggestions_mode`
- Bundle size increase: +2.83 KB (27.43 KB gzipped for harmony tool)

  - Stops gracefully when insufficient unmatched dyes available
- **Persistence**: Saved to localStorage key: `xivdyetools_harmony_companion_dyes`
  - Defaults to 1 if not set (matches original behavior)
  - Validated to stay within 1-3 range
- **Bundle Size**: Minimal increase (+0.54 KB gzipped, 27.97 KB for harmony tool)
- **Examples**:
  - Value 1: Tetradic = 4 base dyes + 3 additional = 7 total
  - Value 2: Tetradic = 4 base dyes + 6 additional = 10 total
  - Value 3: Tetradic = 4 base dyes + 9 additional = 13 total
- **Result**: Exploration users can control detail level from focused (1) to comprehensive (3)

#### Issue 4: Advanced Dye Filters ✅
- Filter UI implemented in Harmony Explorer (3 checkbox filters)
- Exclude Metallic: Hide dyes with "Metallic" in the name
- Exclude Pastel: Hide dyes with "Pastel" in the name
- Exclude Expensive: Hide Jet Black (#13115) & Pure White (#13114)
- Filter settings persisted to localStorage with automatic restoration
- Filters applied after Facewear exclusion in harmony calculation
- Bundle size increase: Minimal (24.60 KB gzipped for harmony tool, up from 22.94 KB)
- Tests verified with TypeScript strict mode, production build successful

#### Advanced Dye Filters Component Refactor ✅
- **Reusable Component**: Extracted filter UI and logic into new `DyeFilters` component (`src/components/dye-filters.ts`)
- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Integrated into Harmony Explorer, Color Matcher, and Dye Mixer tools
- **New Exclusion Filters**:
  - **Exclude Dark Dyes**: Hide dyes that begin with "Dark" in their name
  - **Exclude Cosmic Dyes**: Hide dyes with "Cosmic Exploration" or "Cosmic Fortunes" acquisition
- **Collapsed by Default**: Filters start collapsed to reduce visual clutter
- **Persistent State**: Expanded/collapsed state and filter preferences saved per tool
- **Harmony Explorer Fix**: Excluded dyes now replaced with next-best alternatives in all harmony types
- **Storage Keys**: Tool-specific localStorage keys (e.g., `harmony_filters`, `colormatcher_filters`, `dyemixer_filters`)

#### Theme System Enhancements ✅
- **Custom Header Text Color**: New `--theme-text-header` CSS variable for customizable header text colors
  - Applied to: "XIV Dye Tools" title, version text, harmony card headers, activated buttons, "Generate" button, "Refresh Prices" button
  - Defaults to `--theme-text` color but customizable via Theme Editor
  - All 10 theme palettes updated with `textHeader` property
- **Theme-Aware Button Hover Effects**: All action buttons now use brightness filter for consistent hover feedback
  - Generate button (Harmony Explorer)
  - Clear button (Dye Selector)
  - Refresh Prices button (Market Board)
  - Copy Share URL button (Dye Mixer)
  - Tool navigation buttons (main.ts)
  - Hover: `brightness(0.9)`, Active: `brightness(0.8)`
  - Smooth transitions with `transition-all duration-200`
- **Theme-Aware Input Sliders**: Range inputs use `accent-color: var(--theme-primary)` for theme consistency
  - Color Matcher sample size slider
  - Dye Mixer step count slider
  - All sliders adapt to theme changes automatically

#### UI Fixes & Improvements ✅
- **Logo Path Fix**: Updated logo path to `/assets/icons/icon-192x192.png` with fallback handling
- **Menu Closing Logic**: Tools and Theme dropdowns now close when the other is clicked (cross-component communication)
- **Theme Menu Background**: Fixed transparent background for better readability
- **Header Text Contrast**: Improved readability of "XIV Dye Tools" text across all 10 themes
- **Hardcoded Colors Removed**: Eliminated hardcoded white colors, now uses `--theme-text-header` variable
- **Market Board Default**: "Show Prices" option now defaults to disabled (false)
- **CSS Rule Cleanup**: Removed global `h1-h6` color override that was conflicting with `--theme-text-header`

#### Test Coverage Expansion ✅
- **Total Tests**: 514 passing (up from 140)
  - Service tests: 140
  - UI component tests: 230
  - Tool component tests: 142
